## Project Structure

```
FinanceBros/
â”œâ”€â”€ client/           # React frontend
â”œâ”€â”€ server/           # Go backend
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analytics/    # Analytics services
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ crud/         # Database operations
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types/        # Shared types
```

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FinanceBros.git
cd FinanceBros
```

2. Install Dependencies:

Feeling lazy? We've got you covered! Just run our setup script:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh  # Make it executable first
./setup.sh         # Let the magic happen
```
Or if you're feeling extra lazy, do it all in one go:
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

The script will check if you have all the required tools (npm, node, and Go) and guide you through the installation process.

3. Set up the database:
```bash
# Create a PostgreSQL database named 'financebros'
createdb financebros
```

4. Configure environment variables:
```bash
# In server/.env
DB_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/financebros
PORT=8080
```

5. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
cd client
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd ../server
go mod download
```

6. Start the development servers:
```bash
# From the root directory
npm run dev
```

This will start both the frontend and backend servers concurrently:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:8080
